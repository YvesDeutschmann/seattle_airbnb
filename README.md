# Analysis of Seattle Airbnb listings

## Overview and motivation
My friend told me about the establsihment of AMazon and other tech giants in the area of Seattle and the crazy climb in prices for a space to live in. Planning on visiting this area soon I was curious to see what the Airbnb data might look like. More specifically, I wanted to know more about the price of listings and better understand guest satisfaction.

I used a Kaggle dataset for Seattles Airbnb data from the year 2016. The data can be found here:

## Files
- **AirbnbSeattle.ipynb**: jupyter notebook for analysis of the dataset
- **requirements.txt**: textfile describing python libraries and depencies used for this project
- **neighbourhood.geojson**: json file with geological data for Seattle's neighborhoods
- **neighbourhoods.csv**: csv file with with geological data for Seattle's neighborhoods

## Summary
We found that there is a seasonal climb in homestay price with a peak in the sommer month. Also the prices on a Friday an d Saturday will genrally be higher than for the rest of the week.
We also found that the prices will climb the more you move towards the downtown area. But higher prices doesn't correlate to higher guest satisfaction. In fact the guest satisfaction was lower on average for the most expansive and the cheapest neighborhoods.
